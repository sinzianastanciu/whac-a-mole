# whac-a-mole

Mini game in which the user has to click on the mole to earn points. The mole places itself at a random position in the grid, by changing the background image of the square, repeatedly. There is also a 60 sec timer during which the user has to score up as much as they can. After the timer is finished, the user gets an alert with the score (if there is any).
